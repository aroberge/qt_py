This directory contains some very simple examples using PyQt.

I use Python 3.4 and PyQt 4.10.4 for testing

* window1: simplest possible window, with default values
* window2: simple window with custom values
* window3: simple window using setGeometry instead of two separate methods.
* window4: simple window - class based
