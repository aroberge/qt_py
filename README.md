qt_py
=====

Short term goal
---------------

Become familiar with using PyQt.  As such, this repository should not be
of much use for anyone else.

Longer term goal
---------------

Investigate the possibility of creating a simple set of self-contained widgets,
inspired by easygui, so that they could be used by beginners.

Documentation
-------------

Not planned for the near future; however, a readme file should be
included in most subdirectories.
